    description: "The Toyota GR86 represents the second generation of Toyota's compact sports car previously known simply as the 86 (and before that, the Scion FR-S in some markets), now incorporating Toyota's Gazoo Racing (GR) branding to emphasize its performance focus. Continuing as a joint development with Subaru (which sells its version as the BRZ), the GR86 maintains the fundamental philosophy of its predecessor—a lightweight, affordable rear-wheel-drive sports coupe emphasizing handling balance and driver engagement. The exterior design features more aggressive styling with functional air intakes, a distinct matrix grille pattern, more pronounced fenders, and ducktail rear spoiler, though still clearly evolved from the original 86 rather than a complete redesign. Addressing the most common criticism of the previous generation, the GR86 features a new 2.4-liter naturally aspirated flat-four 'boxer' engine (replacing the 2.0-liter unit) producing 228 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque—a significant increase in both metrics, with the torque now delivered at a more accessible 3,700 rpm compared to the high-revving character of the previous engine. Available with either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission, the GR86 delivers improved acceleration with 0-60 mph times reduced to approximately 6.1 seconds for manual transmission models. Despite the larger engine, curb weight increases only marginally thanks to aluminum roof and fender panels, maintaining the car's nimble character. The chassis features increased rigidity, with front lateral bending rigidity improved by 60 percent for more responsive handling, complemented by retuned suspension. The interior has been modernized with a 7-inch digital instrument cluster featuring a track-focused display mode when in Sport mode, an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and improved materials throughout while maintaining the driver-focused layout. For the first time, automatic transmission models include driver assistance technology including pre-collision braking, adaptive cruise control, and lane departure warning. The GR86 successfully builds upon the strengths of its predecessor while addressing its main shortcomings, continuing to offer an increasingly rare proposition in the modern automotive landscape: an affordable, purpose-built sports car that prioritizes driver involvement over outright performance figures or luxury features."
