## About Toyota GR86 Generations

The Toyota GR86 has gone through two main generations, with the second being a significant redesign of the original 86:

- **First Generation (2012-2020)**: Initially launched as the Toyota GT86 (or simply Toyota 86 in some markets), this model was developed in collaboration with Subaru. It featured a naturally aspirated 2.0L boxer engine producing 200 hp, known for its lightweight design and rear-wheel drive configuration. The first generation received a facelift in 2017 with minor exterior updates and slight performance improvements.

- **Second Generation (2021-present)**: Rebranded as the GR86 under Toyota's Gazoo Racing lineup, the second generation brought significant improvements while maintaining the spirit of the original. Key changes include a larger 2.4L boxer engine producing 228 hp, improved chassis rigidity, and updated styling while keeping the fundamental front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. This generation features enhanced interior quality and modernized technology features. [[Toyota GR86 Official Page]](https://www.toyota.com/gr86/)
